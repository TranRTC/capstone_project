# Project Overview

## Project Name
Web-Based IoT Device Real-Time Monitoring System

## Purpose

### Application Purpose (Why This System is Needed)
There is a need for continuous monitoring of equipment/device in industrial, commercial, and agricultural facilities to ensure operational safety, prevent failures, and optimize performance. This web-based solution monitors IoT device status in real-time and stores historical data for trace-back analysis and data-driven decision-making. It enables remote monitoring of distributed IoT devices across multiple locations, serving as a cost-effective alternative to industrial SCADA systems, which are expensive and dependent on specific hardware and software requirements.

### Capstone Project Purpose (Why This Project Exists)
This capstone project applies knowledge from the Application Development Program (programming languages, databases, software engineering, project management) and hands-on hardware experience (sensors, microcontrollers like Arduino and ESP modules, single-board computers like Raspberry Pi) to solve a real-world problem through technology integration (C# backend, React frontend, RESTful API, SignalR, SQL Server). It demonstrates the application of academic knowledge to practical solutions, serving as evidence of technical expertise for portfolio and professional use.

## Project Description
The Industrial Equipment Real-Time Monitoring System is a comprehensive solution that:
- **Monitors** industrial equipment and devices in real-time
- **Collects** sensor data, operational metrics, and status information
- **Visualizes** data through interactive dashboards and charts
- **Alerts** users to critical events, anomalies, or threshold breaches
- **Tracks** historical performance and trends
- **Supports** multiple devices and equipment types simultaneously

## Technical Stack
- **Backend:** C# (ASP.NET Core Web API)
- **Frontend:** React (with modern UI framework)
- **Real-Time Communication:** SignalR (for WebSocket-based real-time updates)
- **Database:** SQL Server
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js, D3.js, or similar library

## Architecture Overview
- **Backend API:** RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core for data management and business logic
- **Real-Time Hub:** SignalR hub for bidirectional communication between server and clients
- **Frontend Application:** React SPA with component-based architecture
- **Data Layer:** Database for persistent storage of historical data and configurations

## Key Features (Planned)
1. **Real-Time Data Streaming**
   - Live sensor data updates
   - Equipment status monitoring
   - Performance metrics tracking

2. **Dashboard & Visualization**
   - Interactive charts and graphs
   - Customizable dashboard layouts
   - Historical data analysis

3. **Alerting System**
   - Threshold-based alerts
   - Critical event notifications
   - Configurable alert rules

4. **Device Management**
   - Device registration and configuration
   - Equipment metadata management
   - Connection status monitoring

5. **User Interface**
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Role-based access control (if applicable)

## Current Status
- Project repository initialized
- GitHub connected
- 3-2-1 backup strategy set up
- Google Drive used for ZIP snapshot backups (no auto-sync)

## Key Tools
- Git + GitHub for version control
- Google Drive for disaster backups (ZIP files only)
- Windows development environment

## Important Rules
- Do NOT work inside Google Drive folders
- Commit and push to GitHub regularly
- Take ZIP snapshot backups weekly or before risky changes

## Development Phases (Planned)
1. **Phase 1:** Project setup and architecture design
2. **Phase 2:** Backend API development (C#)
3. **Phase 3:** Real-time communication implementation (SignalR)
4. **Phase 4:** Frontend development (React)
5. **Phase 5:** Data visualization and dashboard
6. **Phase 6:** Alerting and notification system
7. **Phase 7:** Testing and optimization
8. **Phase 8:** Documentation and deployment
